* Meanwhile, the abandonment of genealogy produced a society tied particularly strongly to place. Genealogy lends mobility to identity, allowing communities to stretch beyond homelands without sacrii cing rootedness, stringing places along genealogical charts. 28 Altishahris, however, were connected to the saints not by genealogy but by presence, a presence enacted through everyday interaction at local tombs and through pilgrimage to the great shrines of the region. In this context, exile communities in Ferghana and in Yettisu, far from the tombs of the Altishahri saintly canon, were omitted from the picture of the Altishahri identity described in tazkirahs and on shrine walls. According to the tazkirahs, the Four Imams were*Location (142-142)*

* It would be a mistake to view late twentieth- century and early twenty- i rst- century Uyghur historical writing and practice as a simple adoption of (foreign) nationalist ways of imagining identity. Over time, the people of Altishahr did adopt much in the way of foreign nationalist approaches, but that is only part of the story. As successful as nationalist movements were in twentieth- century Altishahr, they competed against and merged with alternative ways of looking at Altishahr’s past and the identity of its inhabitants.

* At some point a connection was drawn between a saint called Haẓrat Mullām, who has a tazkirah and a shrine in the town of Opal, and Maḥmūd Kāshgharī. The shrine at Opal is now attributed to Maḥmūd Kāshgharī, but the connection is tentative at best. The tazkirah of Haẓrat Mullām does not suggest that the saint is Maḥmūd Kāshgharī*Location (301-301)*
